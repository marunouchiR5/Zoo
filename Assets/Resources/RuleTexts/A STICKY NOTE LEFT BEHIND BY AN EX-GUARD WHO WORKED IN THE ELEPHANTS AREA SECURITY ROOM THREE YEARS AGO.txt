To the person taking the shift after me, someone who stumbles across this room, or to a new guard working here greetings. Please, you must follow the instructions on this note, these are experiences I’ve accumulated that can ensure your on-job safety and sanity. I don’t want to lose another colleague and don’t want to experience strange events. I trust that you don’t either. After seeing these, pretend nothing happened and carry on with your duties.
1. At any moment, remember the color of your uniform. It can be any color, red, blue, black. Do not change the colors of your clothing. It is key to remain firm on your self-perception. Do not let IT discover that you are experiencing doubt or panic about the outside world.
2. Believe. Believe. Believe. Humans are worthy of trust. Only humans do.
3. Rabbits eat people; people wearing rabbit ears won’t. The shades eat people; the gardener trimming the trees won’t. The elephants will eat people; the people watching elephants won’t; the people not watching elephants won’t either. White lions eat people; glowing jellyfish won’t.

4. IT will cry when IT is hindered. IT will laugh when it succeeds. Don’t care what IT is, run away whenever you discover IT. They don’t yet know.
5. Any strange food items that appear on shelves are tests. Do not read labels, and do not care how other people call them. Ignore. Purchase and consume them if necessary. Do not let IT know you feel ITs presence.
