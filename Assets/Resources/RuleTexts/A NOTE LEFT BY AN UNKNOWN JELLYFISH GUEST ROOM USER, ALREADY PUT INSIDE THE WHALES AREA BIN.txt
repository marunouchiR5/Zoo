[The beginning and sides are littered with “I am afraid” “I want to survive.” “Don’t Believe” “Do Believe!’ “All messed up!” “I must write it down” Where the title should have been in bold strokes “IF THESE ARE NOT FOLLOWED, THERE IS NO ESCAPE!”]
1. Monkeys and white lions can see IT. Jellyfish and rabbits can soothe IT. Elephants and goats are ITs toys.
2. Trust white lions. White lions bite those with the hope of being saved, and they also bite those without. White lions’ roar is the siren that drives IT away. White lions’ roar is the elegy to the deceased.
3. Changing clothes will be spotted, do not change clothes. [Mad scribble: solidarity, courage, and unshaken loyalty are human’s best advantages]
4. The guards in the Elephants Area are trustworthy. But the end of their shift is 1 am. You must seek help before this.
5. IT likes light, especially at night. IT dislikes claustrophobic spaces. Rest in dark and small rooms.
6. Heck! Goat Meat is really raw meat! [This line is the most sketchy, followed by another sentence in normal handwriting] I can actually fucking eat it.
7. You can’t be discovered when standing next to monkeys.
8. Humans have two eyes, arranged horizontally, one on each side of the nose. Others are not humans. If the appearance of a human changes, he or she is being watched by IT. Do not trust humans that are not humans.
9. Do not care about visitors with smiles on their faces. They haven’t discovered anything. Find people fearful like myself. They are trustworthy. They already know.
10. Thank the dried jellyfish and drowned elephants. Remember that they died for protecting humans.
11. There is an exit, but not in the Monkeys Area. I do not know what that road leads to.
12. At all times, remember you are human, and not animal.
