1. Do not enter when there’s anybody around. If an employee welcomed you after your entrance, find an excuse to leave after reading this.
2. If nobody has appeared up to the point you are reading this, you can stay and visit or rest. All food items are free here, and please help yourself. Take care not to eat “Goat Meat”. If you see items so marked on the shelf, ignore them.
3. This is an aquarium, and only marine animals are on display. If you see an elephant swimming in the Whales Area, do not scream or appear shocked, that is a 3D hologram installed for amusement. Treat it normally, and pretend it is a whale.
4. The aquarium can be used to spend the night. Left of the jellyfish area are guest rooms for tourists. If you need to use a guest room, please switch on the jellyfish night lamp in your room.
5. If you encounter a person in black uniforms claiming to be an employee, you can talk to them. Do not hand your maps to this person, particularly the corner you can tear off following the dashed line.
6. Disobey the above rules, all consequences are at your own cost.
7. The aquarium exists and does not serve any organization.
