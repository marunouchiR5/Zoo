If you are fortunate to see this poster, please lay low. Letting others discover that you can see it is taboo. We believe that you have established based on the visitor guidelines that the zoo is not safe, and even strange. We are an undercover government operation intended to protect the innocent. Please follow the below instructions to keep yourself safe. This is the only way to leave the zoo.
1. Enter the aquarium. Nobody works here. Pick up a set of black uniforms and put it on. This is the only way to signal to our employees. When you are walking outside, do not worry about other zoo employees. They will not mind your existence.
2. Do not visit the Lions Area.
3. Everywhere you go, make sure you can see rabbits present — runaway rabbits, rabbit merchandise, people wearing rabbit ears, or the Rabbit Blood from drink stalls. Rabbits are our symbol and codeword, they represent “SAFETY” and “PROTECTION”.
4. When visiting the Elephants Area, do not read any signage.
5. Do not trust anything written on the map, and do not follow them. If you followed any of them, please check if the map you collected at the zoo entrance has a dashed line. Tear off the corner marked by said dashed line, and make your way to the Rabbits Area. There, feed this piece of paper to a rabbit while avoiding detection, and stay here. You can leave after hearing laughter not produced by visitors, you can leave this area. After this, go to the Monkeys area. The safety exit is at the end of the right passageway.
